Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI architecture that combines retrieval and generation.

The retrieval component searches a vector database for relevant document chunks.

The generation component uses a large language model to produce a final answer based on the retrieved context.

Pinecone is a vector database used to store embeddings.

Embeddings transform text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
